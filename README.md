TIS-JS
======

## What is it?

TIS-JS is a TIS-100 emulator written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [TIS-100]
is a fictional computer featured in the game, also called TIS-100, made by
[Zachtronics]. The objective is to write programs, using limited resources, to
perform specified tasks (in which the old code has become corrupted).

browser to run the emulator.

## Where can I get TIS-100?

You can buy TIS-100 on [Steam] or [GOG]. I prefer GOG as it's DRM-free, but go
with whichever you prefer.
